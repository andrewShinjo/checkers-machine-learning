# Project Brief: Checkers with Machine Learning

## Overview
Building a checkers/draughts implementation in Rust to:
1. Create a complete game engine with:
   - Board representation
   - Game rules enforcement
   - Move validation
2. Serve as foundation for machine learning experiments:
   - Track game states
   - Enable AI agent interaction
   - Support training algorithms

## Goals
1. Create accurate, efficient board representation
2. Implement core game mechanics with ML needs in mind
3. Develop clean, idiomatic Rust code
4. Enable future ML integration through:
   - State serialization
   - Move generation
   - Game outcome tracking

## Non-Goals (Initial Phase)
- Graphical interface
- Network multiplayer
- Complete ML implementation (will come later)
